  Representation learning has emerged as an indispensable ingredient for low-resource language processing. Due to the differences across languages at levels 
  of morphology, syntax, and semantics, it remains challenging to learn generalizable representations and effectively transfer them to a broad spectrum of 
  languages. The first part of this talk will shed light on the difficulties of transferring representations across languages learned by two families of neural 
  architectures (sequential RNN v.s. self-attention) due to word order differences. Furthermore, we present an approach to learn syntactic dependencies between 
  words, facilitating cross-lingual information extraction. The second part of this talk will discuss our recent work on joint representing learning for 
  programming and natural language that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream software engineering tasks.
