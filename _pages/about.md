<p align="justify">
I am a senior research scientist in the Applied Research on AI Applications team at NVIDIA. We work on foundation models with a focus on code generation, mathematical reasoning, long-context understanding, and model robustness. Before NVIDIA, I was at AWS AI Labs, working on code generation for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/">Amazon Q Developer</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/">University of California Los Angeles</a>, supervised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>. I was fortunate to work as a research intern at Meta AI, Yahoo Research, Microsoft Research, and Walmart Labs during my PhD.

  Before joining AWS, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California Los Angeles, in September 2021. I was part of the UCLA NLP group, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>. Previously, I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, in February 2013, and my Master of Computer Science from the University of Virginia, in August 2017. I like to solve problems to improve my programming skills in 
  my free time. I have answered <b><font color="blue">500+</font></b> questions on StackOverflow and earned 
  <b><font color="blue">30,000+</font></b> reputation.
