Privacy policies provide individuals with information about their rights and how their personal information is handled. Natural language understanding 
  (NLU) technologies can support individuals and practitioners to understand better privacy practices described in lengthy and complex documents. However, 
  existing efforts that use NLU technologies are limited by processing the language in a way exclusive to a single task focusing on certain privacy 
  practices. To this end, we introduce the Privacy Policy Language Understanding Evaluation (PLUE) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the 
  privacy policy language understanding across various tasks. We also collect a large corpus of privacy policies to enable privacy policy domain-specific 
  language model pre-training. We demonstrate that domain-specific pre-training offers performance improvements across all tasks. We release the benchmark 
  to encourage future research in this domain.
