While pre-trained language models (LM) for code have achieved great success in code completion, they generate code conditioned only on the contents 
  within the file, i.e., in-file context, but ignore the rich semantics in other files within the same project, i.e., cross-file context, a critical source of information that is 
  especially useful in modern modular software development. Such overlooking constrains code language modelsâ€™ capacity in code completion, leading to 
  unexpected behaviors such as generating hallucinated class member functions or function calls with unexpected arguments. In this work, we develop a 
  cross-file context finder tool, CCFinder, that effectively locates and retrieves the most relevant cross-file context. We propose CoCoMIC, a framework 
  that incorporates cross-file context to learn the in-file and cross-file context jointly on top of pretrained code LMs. CoCoMIC successfully improves the 
  existing code LM with a 19.30% relative increase in exact match and a 15.41% relative increase in identifier matching for code completion when the 
  cross-file context is provided.
