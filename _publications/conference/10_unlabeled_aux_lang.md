Cross-lingual transfer learning has become an important weapon to battle the unavailability of annotated resources for 
low-resource languages. One of the fundamental techniques to transfer across languages is learning language-agnostic 
representations, in the form of word embeddings or contextual encodings. In this work, we propose to leverage unannotated 
sentences from auxiliary languages to help learning language-agnostic representations. Specifically, we explore adversarial 
training for learning contextual encoders that produce invariant representations across languages to facilitate cross-lingual
transfer. We conduct experiments on cross-lingual dependency parsing where we train a dependency parser on a source language
and transfer it to a wide range of target languages. Experiments on 28 target languages demonstrate that adversarial training 
significantly improves the overall transfer performances under several different settings. We conduct a careful analysis to 
evaluate the language-agnostic representations resulted from adversarial training.
